      <h4 class="research-title">Network GWAS</h4>
      <div class="research-description">
        In recent years, in order to support the research activities in computational biology and genomics, we have been focusing on developing effective computational methods for finding and analyzing modular structures in <strong>large (biological) networks</strong>.
      </div>
      <div class="research-description">
        The network GWAS and co-expression network approaches described above rely heavily on accurately and efficiently finding network modules. Nevertheless, finding structures in large networks is a challenging problem in machine learning and datamining. We considered different types of information for network module finding and developed effective novel methods for finding modules of nodes, modules of links, and modules that are defined by network structural information and node semantics.
